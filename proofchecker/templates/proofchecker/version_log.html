        <ul>
            <li>Proof Buddy deployment to off VPN</li>
            <li>Feature added: using a saved proof – instructor must say whether allowed, student must have correct proof saved under certain name.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Feature added: a button which inserts a comment line (i.e. the user can type any text they wish: this line is fully ignored by the parser and does not affect the step count for the proof).</li>
            <li>Feature added: let the instructor import a csv of userids, email_address and then that creates en masse a bunch of student accounts registered for that course.</li>
            <li>Feature added: “disprove" mode – the user enters in T/F for each variable, and ProofBuddy checks that all the premises evaluate to True, but the conclusion is False.</li>
            <li>Feature added: exportation into LaTex, Jupyter.</li>
            <li>Feature added: export to csv – students and assignment scores to upload to BBLearn.</li>
